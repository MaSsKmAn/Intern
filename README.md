## Introduction

The **Rule-Based Chatbot** is a simple conversational agent that responds to user queries by matching their inputs with predefined rules. This type of chatbot is ideal for handling specific tasks or responding to a limited set of queries where the responses can be anticipated and programmed in advance.

## Features

- Responds to user inputs based on predefined rules
- Easily customizable to fit specific use cases
- No machine learning required, making it lightweight and fast
- Ideal for simple customer service, FAQs, or guided conversation flows

## How It Works

The chatbot operates on a set of rules defined by patterns of user inputs. These patterns can be exact matches, keywords, or regular expressions. When the chatbot receives an input, it scans through its list of rules to find a match. Once a match is found, it returns the corresponding response.

### Example Rule

```python
{
    "pattern": "hello",
    "response": "Hello! How can I help you today?"
}
```
# Image Captioning

## Introduction

The **Image Captioning** project aims to automatically generate textual descriptions for images. This is achieved by combining computer vision techniques with natural language processing (NLP). The model takes an image as input and outputs a sentence that describes the content of the image. Such models have applications in various fields, including accessibility for the visually impaired, content generation, and human-computer interaction.

## Features

- Automatic generation of captions for images
- Pre-trained model available for quick inference
- Custom training pipeline for new datasets
- Transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs for feature extraction
- Support for beam search decoding for improved caption quality

## How It Works

The image captioning model works by first extracting features from an image using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) like ResNet or Inception. These features are then passed to a recurrent neural network (RNN), typically an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network, which generates a sequence of words that form a coherent sentence describing the image.

### Workflow

1. **Feature Extraction:** Use a pre-trained CNN to extract visual features from the input image.
2. **Sequence Generation:** Pass the extracted features to an RNN to generate a sequence of words that form a sentence.
3. **Caption Generation:** The RNN generates captions word by word until it predicts an end-of-sentence token.

## Model Architecture

The image captioning model consists of two main components:

### 1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
   - **Role:** Extract visual features from the input image.
   - **Implementation:** Commonly used CNN architectures include ResNet, VGG, and Inception, which are pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet.
   - **Output:** A feature vector representing the image.

### 2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**
   - **Role:** Generate a sequence of words (caption) based on the image features.
   - **Implementation:** Typically implemented using LSTM or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit).
   - **Input:** The feature vector from the CNN.
   - **Output:** A sentence describing the image.

# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

## Introduction

The **Tic-Tac-Toe AI** project aims to create an unbeatable opponent for the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to evaluate all possible moves and select the optimal one, ensuring it either wins or forces a draw. This project is a great way to learn about game trees, recursive algorithms, and AI in simple board games.

## Features

- Unbeatable AI using the minimax algorithm
- Playable in the command line or via a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Configurable board size (default is 3x3)
- Supports two-player mode and player vs AI mode
- Intelligent move evaluation for an optimal game strategy

## How It Works

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking a spot on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks (either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game. If all spots are filled and no player has aligned three marks, the game ends in a draw.

### AI Strategy

The AI employs the **minimax algorithm** to determine its moves. The algorithm explores all possible game states, simulating every potential move the player and the AI can make. It then evaluates the game states to choose the move that maximizes the AI's chance of winning while minimizing the player's chance.

### Minimax Algorithm

- **Maximizing Player (AI):** The AI tries to maximize its score by choosing the move that offers the highest chance of winning.
- **Minimizing Player (Human):** The human player tries to minimize the AI's score, aiming for the move that delays or prevents the AI's win.
- **Recursive Search:** The algorithm recursively explores all possible moves, simulating the entire game tree.
- **Optimal Move Selection:** After evaluating all possible game outcomes, the AI selects the move that leads to the best outcome.
